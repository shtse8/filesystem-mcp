# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the **Filesystem MCP Server** (`@sylphlab/filesystem-mcp`).

This server acts as a secure and efficient bridge between AI agents (like Cline/Claude using the Model Context Protocol) and your local project files.

## Key Goals

- **Security**: Confine AI filesystem access strictly within your project directory.
- **Efficiency**: Reduce AI-server communication overhead and token usage through batch operations.
- **Control**: Operate predictably using relative paths within the project context.
- **Standardization**: Adhere to the Model Context Protocol for interoperability.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to use the server is via `npx` or `bunx`, configured within your MCP host environment. Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/sylphlab/filesystem-mcp#readme) for detailed setup instructions.

This documentation site will provide further details on available tools, configuration options, and development guidelines.
