# Active Context: Filesystem MCP Server (Context Limit Transition)

## 1. Current Work Focus & Status

**Task:** Fix failing `editFile.ts` tests (Regex replace/delete).
**Status:** Debugging blocked. Attempted to revert CRLF handling logic in Regex creation and remove debug logs using `apply_diff`, but the tool failed repeatedly due to file content changes between `read_file` and `apply_diff` operations. The file state is likely inconsistent. Coverage report generation is also still failing. Context limit (~293k) reached.
**Problem:** Two tests remain failing:
    - `should successfully replace content using regex` (Expected 'success', got 'skipped', logs indicate `regex.exec` loop doesn't run)
    - `should successfully delete content using regex` (Expected 'success', got 'skipped', logs indicate `regex.exec` loop doesn't run)
**Debugging Attempts:** Previous attempts involved adding/removing logs and modifying Regex logic, but were hampered by `apply_diff` failures.

## 2. Recent Changes/Decisions

- ...(Previous entries omitted)...
- Attempted to revert CRLF handling logic via `apply_diff`, failed.
- **Context Limit Transition:** Initiating transition due to context size (~293k chars) and persistent tool failures.

## 3. Next Steps (Post-Transition)

1.  **Read ALL Memory Bank files.**
2.  **Verify Git Status:** Ensure working directory is clean.
3.  **Read `src/handlers/editFile.ts`:** Get the definitive current state.
4.  **Manually Revert CRLF Logic & Remove Logs:** Since `apply_diff` is unreliable, use `write_to_file` with the *entire corrected file content*, ensuring the Regex creation logic is reverted to `regex = new RegExp(search_pattern, 'g');` and all `[DEBUG editFile]` logs are removed.
5.  **Run tests (`npm test`)**.
6.  **Analyze results:** If tests still fail, the issue with `regex.exec` loop execution persists and needs further investigation, possibly by simplifying the test case or handler logic temporarily. If tests pass, proceed to investigate coverage report issue.

## 4. Active Decisions

- **Testing Framework:** Vitest.
- **Testing Strategy:** Primarily integration testing.
- **Skipped Tests:** `chmodItems`, `chownItems`.
- **`edit_file` Regex Status:** Logic seems flawed; `regex.exec` loop doesn't execute. **2 tests failing (regex replace/delete)**. Debugging blocked by tool failures and context limit.
- **`apply_diff` Unreliability:** Avoid using `apply_diff` on `src/handlers/editFile.ts` until file stability is confirmed. Prefer `write_to_file` for now.
- (Previous decisions remain active unless superseded).
