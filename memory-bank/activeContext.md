# Active Context: Filesystem MCP Server (Context Limit Transition)

## 1. Current Work Focus & Status

**Task:** Fix failing `editFile.ts` tests (Regex replace/delete).
**Status:** Debugging in progress. Multiple attempts to fix Regex matching logic (`while ((match = regex.exec(...))`) have failed. `apply_diff` tool is consistently failing when trying to add debug logs or apply fixes, possibly due to file corruption or rapid changes between operations. Coverage report generation is also still failing.
**Problem:** Two tests remain failing:
    - `should successfully replace content using regex` (Expected 'success', got 'skipped', logs indicate `regex.exec` loop doesn't run)
    - `should successfully delete content using regex` (Expected 'success', got 'skipped', logs indicate `regex.exec` loop doesn't run)
**Debugging Attempts:** Added logs around `regex.exec`, but `apply_diff` failed repeatedly. Last successful file read was at 12:55:29 PM.

## 2. Recent Changes/Decisions

- ...(Previous entries omitted)...
- Fixed assertion in `should handle insertion at the beginning` test.
- Attempted multiple fixes for Regex matching logic in `editFile.ts`.
- Attempted to add debug logs via `apply_diff`, but failed repeatedly.
- **Context Limit Transition:** Initiating transition due to context size (~206k chars) and persistent tool failures.

## 3. Next Steps (Post-Transition)

1.  **Read ALL Memory Bank files.**
2.  **Verify Git Status:** Ensure working directory is clean after transition commit.
3.  **Read `src/handlers/editFile.ts`:** Get the definitive current state of the file.
4.  **Verify Code Structure:** Manually review the code around the Regex matching loop (approx lines 180-240) and the state synchronization block (approx lines 315-336) for any obvious errors introduced by previous failed diffs/writes.
5.  **Fix Obvious Errors (if any):** Use `write_to_file` with the *entire corrected file content* if structural errors are found.
6.  **Re-attempt Minimal Debugging (if needed):** If no obvious errors, try adding *one* simple `console.log` right before the `while ((match = regex.exec(currentContent)) !== null)` loop (around line 188) using `apply_diff` with carefully verified line numbers from the fresh read.
7.  **Run tests (`npm test`)**.
8.  **Analyze logs/results** to understand why the `regex.exec` loop isn't executing.

## 4. Active Decisions

- **Testing Framework:** Vitest.
- **Testing Strategy:** Primarily integration testing.
- **Skipped Tests:** `chmodItems`, `chownItems`.
- **`edit_file` Regex Status:** Logic seems flawed; `regex.exec` loop doesn't execute even when `regex.test` passes. **2 tests failing (regex replace/delete)**. Debugging deferred pending context reset.
- (Previous decisions remain active unless superseded).
