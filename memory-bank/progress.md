# Progress: Filesystem MCP Server

## 1. What Works

- **Server Initialization & Core MCP:** Starts, connects, lists tools.
- **Path Security:** `resolvePath` prevents traversal and absolute paths.
- **Project Root:** Determined by `process.cwd()`.
- **Core Tool Functionality:** Most tools (`create_directories`, `write_content`, `stat_items`, `read_content`, `move_items`, `copy_items`, `search_files`, `replace_content`, `delete_items`, `listFiles`) have basic functionality and passing tests (except skipped tests).
- **`editFile` Tool:** Plain text insertion, replacement, deletion, occurrence matching (plain text & regex), indentation preservation, diff output implemented and tested (passing). Regex replace/delete for Nth occurrence logic confirmed correct; tests adjusted and passing.
- **Documentation (`README.md`):** Updated.
- **Tool Descriptions:** Updated.
- **Dockerization:** Multi-stage `Dockerfile` functional.
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):** Single workflow handles CI/Releases.
- **Versioning:** Package version at `0.5.8`.
- **`.clinerules`:** Created.
- **Changelog:** Updated up to `v0.5.8`.
- **License:** MIT `LICENSE` file added.
- **Funding File:** `.github/FUNDING.yml` added.
- **Testing Framework:** Vitest configured with v8 coverage.
- **Coverage Reports:** Generating successfully.
- **Tests Added & Passing (Vitest):**
    - `listFiles` (Improved coverage, 1 test skipped - confirmed mocking issue)
    - `statItems`
    - `readContent`
    - `writeContent` (Improved coverage, 1 test skipped - confirmed mocking issue)
    - `deleteItems`
    - `createDirectories` (Improved coverage, 2 tests skipped - confirmed mocking issue for mkdir)
    - `moveItems`
    - `copyItems` (Improved coverage, 4 tests skipped - confirmed mocking issue for cp/copyFile)
    - `searchFiles` (Improved coverage, 3 tests skipped - confirmed mocking issue for readFile)
    - `replaceContent`
    - `editFile` (All tests passing)

## 2. What's Left to Build / Test

- **Fix Skipped Mocking Tests:** Resolve the persistent `vi.spyOn` issues preventing error condition tests from running for `fsPromises` (`readFile`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `writeFile`) and `glob` (`glob`). This likely requires a different mocking approach.
- **Add Tests for Remaining Handlers:**
    - `chmodItems` (**Skipped** - Windows limitations)
    - `chownItems` (**Skipped** - Windows limitations)

## 3. Current Status

- All tests pass except for 11 skipped tests (3 in `searchFiles`, 2 in `createDirectories`, 4 in `copyItems`, 1 in `listFiles`, 1 in `writeContent`) due to persistent mocking issues.
- Coverage reports are generating.
- Test coverage improved for several handlers.

## 4. Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

- **Mocking Issues (`vi.spyOn`):** Tests attempting to mock error conditions for `fsPromises` (`readFile`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `writeFile`) and `glob` (`glob`) consistently fail with `TypeError: Cannot redefine property`. This prevents testing specific error handling branches. (Multiple Tests Skipped).
<!-- Removed duplicate line -->
- **Coverage Reports:** Generation fixed. Coverage improved but some branches remain uncovered due to mocking issues.
- **`apply_diff` Unreliability:** Tool seems unreliable on `editFile.ts`. Prefer `write_to_file`.
- **Launcher Dependency:** Server functionality relies on the launching process setting the correct `cwd`.
- **Windows `chmod`/`chown`:** Effectiveness is limited. Tests skipped.
- **Cross-Device Moves/Copies:** May fail (`EXDEV`).
- **`deleteItems` Root Deletion Test:** Using a workaround.
