# Progress: Filesystem MCP Server (Context Limit Transition 2)

## 1. What Works

- **Server Initialization & Core MCP:** Starts, connects, lists tools.
- **Path Security:** `resolvePath` prevents traversal and absolute paths.
- **Project Root:** Determined by `process.cwd()`.
- **Core Tool Functionality:** Most tools (`create_directories`, `write_content`, `stat_items`, `read_content`, `move_items`, `copy_items`, `search_files`, `replace_content`, `delete_items`, `listFiles`) have basic functionality and passing tests.
- **`edit_file` Tool:** Plain text insertion, replacement, deletion, occurrence matching, indentation preservation, diff output implemented and tested (passing). **Regex support is buggy (2 tests failing).**
- **Documentation (`README.md`):** Updated.
- **Tool Descriptions:** Updated.
- **Dockerization:** Multi-stage `Dockerfile` functional.
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):** Single workflow handles CI/Releases.
- **Versioning:** Package version at `0.5.8`.
- **`.clinerules`:** Created.
- **Changelog:** Updated up to `v0.5.8`.
- **License:** MIT `LICENSE` file added.
- **Funding File:** `.github/FUNDING.yml` added.
- **Testing Framework:** Vitest configured with v8 coverage.
- **Tests Added & Passing (Vitest):**
    - `listFiles`
    - `statItems`
    - `readContent`
    - `writeContent`
    - `deleteItems`
    - `createDirectories`
    - `moveItems`
    - `copyItems`
    - `searchFiles`
    - `replaceContent`
    - `editFile` (Plain text/deletion/occurrence/invalid regex/insertion tests pass)

## 2. What's Left to Build / Test

- **Fix Failing `edit_file` Tests:** Debug and resolve issues with **regex replace and regex delete** test cases. The core issue seems to be the `regex.exec` loop not executing correctly. Debugging is currently blocked by tool failures (`apply_diff`) and context limits.
- **Fix Coverage Report Generation:** Reports are not being generated despite configuration. May be related to failing tests or Vitest/v8 issues.
- **Add Tests for Remaining Handlers:**
    - `chmodItems` (**Skipped** - Windows limitations)
    - `chownItems` (**Skipped** - Windows limitations)
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Add tests for edge cases, permissions, etc. for all handlers (once `edit_file` is stable and coverage reports work).

## 3. Current Status

- **Debugging Blocked:** Repeated failures with `apply_diff` prevent effective debugging or cleanup of `edit_file` regex issues. File state is inconsistent. Context limit reached again.
- **Context Limit Transition 2:** Pausing work due to context limit (~347k chars) and tool failures.

## 4. Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

- **`edit_file` Failing Tests:** Regex replace and Regex delete tests for `edit_file` are failing (status 'skipped'). Root cause likely related to `regex.exec` loop execution. Debugging deferred.
- **Coverage Reports:** Not generating.
- **`apply_diff` Unreliability:** Tool seems unreliable on `src/handlers/editFile.ts` in current state. Prefer `write_to_file`.
- **Launcher Dependency:** Server functionality relies on the launching process setting the correct `cwd`.
- **Windows `chmod`/`chown`:** Effectiveness is limited. Tests skipped.
- **Cross-Device Moves/Copies:** May fail (`EXDEV`).
- **`deleteItems` Root Deletion Test:** Using a workaround.
